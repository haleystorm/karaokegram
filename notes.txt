Just a random stream of things I learned while building this... I'm new to node. Quickly getting less new.

Oh... so that is where the http services are implemented.

YouTube Search

Many request search for publicly available content and therefore don't require authentication. When you
submit an unauthenticated request, you need to include a unique API key for your application.

Create and use a server key if your application runs on a server. Do not use this key outside of your server code. For example, do not embed it in a web page. To prevent quota theft, restrict your key so that requests are only allowed from your servers' source IP addresses.
